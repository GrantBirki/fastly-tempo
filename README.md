Monitor, Alert, and Display all your Fastly Metrics in Real-Time!

This is based off the New Relic blessed way to get your Fastly metrics into New Relic Insights, packaged as a Docker container image for ease of use!

In order to use the Fastly Tempo Docker image, you will need an active New Relic account with Insights, an active Fastly account with Read access, a New Relic Insights Insert key and a Fastly API Key.

## Dashboard üó∫Ô∏è

Here is an example of a 4xx alert dashboard that can be created in New Relic from the `Fastly Tempo` container:

## Supported Backends üß∞

Currently, there is only one support backend to send metrics to: `New Relic`

However, there are plans to integrate with other providers/backends in the future for greater integrations.

* New Relic: Supported ‚úîÔ∏è
* Datadog: Planned
* Prometheus: Planned
* Graphite: Planned
* Splunk: Planned

## Quick Start ‚≠ê

Grab the image from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/grantbirki/fastly-tempo) üê≥

### Using Docker-Compose (Preferred)

Using Docker-Compose to run this image is extremely easy.

1. Create a file named `creds.env` at the root of this repo with the following contents:

    ```ini
    ACCOUNT_ID=#######
    INSERT_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    FASTLY_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    ```

2. Add your services to `config.env`

    ```ini
    ...
    SERVICES=ServiceName1:ServiceId1 ServiceName2:ServiceId2 ...
    ```

3. Run: `make run`

4. ‚úîÔ∏è Log into New Relic and view your logs!

### Using Docker

1. Build: `docker build -t fastly-tempo .`
2. Run:

    ```bash
    docker run \
      -e ACCOUNT_ID='yourNewRelicAccountId' \
      -e FASTLY_KEY='yourFastlyKey' \
      -e INSERT_KEY='yourNewRelicInsertKey' \
      -e SERVICES='ServiceId1 ServiceId2 ...' \
      fastly-tempo
    ```

## How to use this image üìö

Before you get started, make sure that you have a [Fastly API Key](https://docs.fastly.com/guides/account-management-and-security/using-api-tokens) and a [New Relic Insert Key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/insert-custom-events-insights-api#register).

The Fastly Tempo image is configured by environment variables.

These are required:

* `ACCOUNT_ID`
* `FASTLY_KEY`
* `INSERT_KEY`
* `SERVICES`

These are optional:

* `SILENT` - Print output True/False. Default: `False`
* `INTERVAL` - Interval in seconds to poll data from Fastly. Default: `1`

Note: It is suggested to use a minimum `INTERVAL` of `1` second to avoid publishing metrics for the same second twice.

### Fastly Services

You have two options for passing in Fastly Services to the Docker container.

1. Passing in only the **ServiceId**
2. Passing in both the **ServiceName** and the **ServiceId**

Note: In both examples, one serivce has millions of 200s and the other has none.

#### 1. ServiceId

If you are just using the ServiceId method, `SERVICES` needs to be a string with the ids of the Fastly services you want to see data for in Insights, separated by a space. I know that's not ideal. A limitation of Fastly is that you have to query one service at a time, so I chose to create an array of service ids and loop through them to query Fastly. A limitation of Docker is that you can't pass an array via the command line, so I chose to split a string on " ". If you have a better idea, I would love to hear it - please contribute!

Example:

```bash
docker run \
  -e ACCOUNT_ID='yourNewRelicAccountId' \
  -e FASTLY_KEY='yourFastlyKey' \
  -e INSERT_KEY='yourNewRelicInsertKey' \
  -e SERVICES='ServiceId1 ServiceId2 ...' \
  fastly-tempo
```

You may optionally add `-e SILENT=True` or `-e INTERVAL=<time in seconds>` for custom configuration.

Here is what this will look like in New Relic:

![ServieId Only Image](assets/img/service-id-only.png)

#### 2. ServiceId + ServiceName

If you want to map your ServiceId to a friendly name use this method. This method is the same as `1. ServiceId` above with one minor change. With this method `SERVICES` needs to be a string with the `<NameOfService>:<ServiceId>` of the Fastly services you want to see data for in Insights, separated by a space (Example below).

The benefit to using this method is you can name the service whatever you want. It could be a friendly name, the actual name of the service in Fastly, or your favorite planet.

Example:

```bash
docker run \
  -e ACCOUNT_ID='yourNewRelicAccountId' \
  -e FASTLY_KEY='yourFastlyKey' \
  -e INSERT_KEY='yourNewRelicInsertKey' \
  -e SERVICES='NameOfService1:ServiceId1 NameOfService2:ServiceId2 ...' \
  fastly-tempo
```

You may optionally add `-e SILENT=True` or `-e INTERVAL=<time in seconds>` for custom configuration.

Here is what this will look like in New Relic:

![ServieId Only Image](assets/img/friendly-service-name.png)

Note: You can mix `method 1` and `method 2` together. In the `SERVICES` variable. I would not recommend doing this though.

## Dashboard Examples üó∫Ô∏è

Below are a few screenshots of dashboards that can be created with this project:

Note: *example.com would be replaced by the `serviceName` which you specify with the `SERVICES` env var*

## New Relic Queries to View Data üìä

Here are some helpful queries in New Relic to start viewing your metrics:

Hint: *You may also use the pre-made Dashboard JSON template below*

* 2xx Status codes by service

    ```sql
    SELECT average(status_2xx) FROM FastlyLogAggregate since 30 minutes ago TIMESERIES 15 minutes facet service
    ```

* 3xx Status codes by service

    ```sql
        SELECT average(status_3xx) FROM FastlyLogAggregate since 30 minutes ago TIMESERIES 15 minutes facet service
    ```

* 4xx Status codes by service

    ```sql
    SELECT average(status_4xx) FROM FastlyLogAggregate since 30 minutes ago TIMESERIES 15 minutes facet service
    ```

* 5xx Status codes by service

    ```sql
    SELECT average(status_5xx) FROM FastlyLogAggregate since 30 minutes ago TIMESERIES 15 minutes facet service
    ```

* The number of cache hits by service

    ```sql
    SELECT average(hits) FROM FastlyLogAggregate since 30 minutes ago TIMESERIES 15 minutes facet service
    ```

* The number of cache misses by service

    ```sql
    SELECT average(miss) FROM FastlyLogAggregate since 30 minutes ago TIMESERIES 15 minutes facet service
    ```

* The total amount of time spent processing cache misses (in seconds)

    ```sql
    SELECT average(miss_time) FROM FastlyLogAggregate since 30 minutes ago TIMESERIES 15 minutes facet service
    ```

To see more info on these queries, check out the blog post by New Relic [here](https://blog.newrelic.com/engineering/monitor-fastly-data/).

## Dashboard JSON Template üìã

Rather than build out a monitoring Dashboard by hand (using the commands above), this repo comes with a pre-made one to get you going!

You can simply `copy and paste` the JSON template located [here](assets/dashboards/new_relic.json) into New Relic and it will be created for you.

Note: You **will** need to **change** all occurances of the `"accountId": 1234567` value in the `.json` file to your own New Relic accountId.

New Relic Docs in-case you need them for the import - [documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/#get-started)
